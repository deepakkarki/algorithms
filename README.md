# Data Structures and Algorithms
A collection of various data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. 

> While I understand that python may not be the best language to implement simple data structures such as linked lists, queues and trees; it is the simplest languages to tackle more complex data structures and algorithms. Since I wanted to keep all the examples to one language only, I chose python to tackle both the simple and complex solutions. 

The project is divided as follows

Each Data structure/Algorithm is going to be a python package with sample test cases included. Each function will have the necessary doc string, and clear explanation of what and how the function does it. At the beginning of the file, The overview of the algorithm will be mentioned. This will make it easier to understand and reimplement the various algorithms explained in this repo.
