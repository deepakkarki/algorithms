# Data Structures and Algorithms
A collection of various data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. 

> While I understand that python may not be the best language to implement simple data structures such as linked lists, queues and trees; it is the simplest languages to tackle more complex data structures and algorithms. Since I wanted to keep all the examples to one language only, I chose python to tackle both the simple and complex solutions. 

The project is divided as follows
```
/data_structures -> collection of all the data structures
  /name of DS -> each DS is in it's own folder and is a package (will probably have it's own test cases)
/algorithms -> collection of all algorithms
  /name of algo -> same as in the case of DS
```
